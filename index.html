                <p>
                    <strong>Cat Person</strong>, born in '95 and still kickin'. Impulsive road trip planner that spends too much time awake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gaming since the Pentium&nbsp;II era and graduated in '16 with great pleasure and distinction at Thomas More Mechelen's <strong>Interactive Multimedia & Design</strong>.

                <h2>I create things, online</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy <strong>making</strong> things, working on that special animation or fine-tuning that little bit of responsive motion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And when all the little things <strong>click</strong>, when all the little cogs have been oiled and my creation reaches its final form, I'll feel a huge rush of excitement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That rush and the feeling of accomplishment that goes with it is why I <strong>love</strong> what I do.

                    <h2>Antwerp Voting App</h2>
                    <p>Antwerp was looking for a way to modernise and improve their voting infrastructure.</p>
                    <P>To help them achieve this goal, I spearheaded a project at <a href="https://www.flowpilots.com">Flow Pilots</a> to create a multi-client redux-based Angular application with live update functionality through websockets.</P>
                    <p>I'd love to show you but the actual application itself is locked in a carefully secured environment to avoid any political tampering. Which was also a key cornerstone during development.</p>

                    <h2>Project Jackhammer</h2>
                    <p>As a creative outlet, I started up a little side project while I was in college. It aimed to draw <a href="https://www.smitegame.com/">Smite's</a> characters in a very minimalist 'flat' style.</p>
                    <p>It gained a little bit of traction and eventually got taken over by an affiliate of <a href="https://www.hirezstudios.com/">Hi-Rez Studios</a>, the creators of Smite, to be used in their clothing line.</p>
