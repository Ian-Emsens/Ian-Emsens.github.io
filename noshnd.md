# In Progress

#### Gurf's Mouth (status: lowest priority, T- 9 days)
The dwarf's mouth is sealed by sovereign glue. A faerie at the black market requires rare moonstone and giant's wood sap to undo.

## Gulakkr's Armor (status: lowest priority, T- 9 days)
The orc's armor appears bound to them, impeding their rest and general welfare.

## The Two Towers (status: unknown)
We investigated an out-of-place looking bridge and are assuming the magically protected towers shoot evil entities.
In Loch Nosh we heard a rumour that the towers have stopped working due to the increased nearby undead.

## The Hooded Man's Request (status: tentative)
A suspicious robed man is looking for a singular sentence from a spell tome in the Moonstone Mountains.

## The Dwarven Troupe (status: in the dungeon of Drachenfells)
Two artificers have offered their services, they have made a bad(ass) dragon dildo in the past. They'll craft the king a crown. They want wands to build a wand golem.

## The Undead Menace (status: on hold)
An undead revenant and a flaming skull have been plaguing a nearby port town.

## Moonstone Smithing (status: in progress)
Loch Nosh's dwarven blacksmith buys moonstone ore.

## Ziggs's Juice (status: in progress)
Ziggs wants Giantwoods's Sap in exchange for one cursed item from their wares.

## The Party Boat (status: passive)
The boat docked in Loch Nosh is a restaurant run by a powerful seaweed-wizard.

## The Asylum (status: mildly interested)
Loch Nosh's asylum is filled with Nyad-rejected noble bitches.

## Loch Nosh's Spire (status: rumoured)
There's a mysterious tower wizard in Loch Nosh.

## The Council's Request (status: ignored)
Loch Nosh's council asked us to do something about the recent undead spotted near the town.
