# In Progress

## Gurf's Mouth (status: acquiring Amberwood sap, T- 8 days)
The dwarf's mouth is sealed by sovereign glue. A faerie at the black market requires rare Moonstone Ore and Amberwood Sap to undo.
Having arrived at The Amberwoods we found the trees but were stopped by Hammerfist the giant. We negotiated **some** vials in exchange for completing Hammerfist's Request.

## Gulakkr's Armor (status: forgotten, T- 9 days)
The orc's armor appears bound to them, impeding their rest and general welfare.

## The Two Towers (status: rumoured)
We investigated an out-of-place looking bridge and are assuming the magically protected towers shoot evil entities.
In Loch Nosh we heard a rumour that the towers have stopped working due to the increased nearby undead.

## The Hooded Man's Request (status: tentative)
A suspicious robed man is looking for a singular sentence from a spell tome in the Moonstone Mountains.

## The Dwarven Troupe (status: in the dungeon of Drachenfells)
Two artificers have offered their services, they have made a bad(ass) dragon dildo in the past.
They'll craft the king a crown. They want wands to build a wand golem.

## The Undead Menace (status: forgotten)
An undead revenant and a flaming skull have been plaguing a nearby port town.

## Moonstone Smithing (status: in progress)
Loch Nosh's dwarven blacksmith buys Moonstone Ore.

## Ziggs's Juice (status: in progress)
Ziggs wants Amberwood Sap in exchange for one cursed item from their wares.
We're on our way to complete Hammerfist's request.

## The Party Boat (status: passive)
The boat docked in Loch Nosh is a restaurant run by a powerful seaweed-wizard.

## The Asylum (status: mildly interested)
Loch Nosh's asylum is filled with Nyad-rejected noble bitches.

## Loch Nosh's Spire (status: rumoured)
There's a mysterious tower wizard in Loch Nosh.

## The Council's Request (status: forgotten)
Loch Nosh's council asked us to do something about the recent undead spotted near the town.

## Hammerfist's Request (status: on our way to Hammerfist)
Hammerfist has asked you to keep the forest quiet by freeing the villagers from slavers to the north.
We liberated the villagers from the slavers and will move out in the morning back to the Amberwood town.

## Warptoken Cache (status: rumoured)
Tchreet mentioned there is a cache of rare magical tokens in the Amberwood Lizardman village, near the three-pointed mushroom.

## Tchreet's Master (status: rumoured)
Tchreet the cowardly rat is evidently controlled by a wizard. Only Gurf knows this.

## Tom the Slaver's letter (status: letter unopened)
Sinjeep found a wax-sealed letter on the corpse of the slavers's leader.

## Kobra's Favour (status: heads in Toms's bags)
Tom the slavers's leader mentioned he had beef with Kobra, showing his head might get us a reward.
