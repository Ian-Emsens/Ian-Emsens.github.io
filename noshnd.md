## Gurf's Mouth (status: active, T- 10 days)
The dwarf's mouth is sealed by sovereign glue. A faerie at the black market requires rare Moonstone Ore and Giantwoods Sap to undo.
Having arrived at The Amberwoods we found the trees but were stopped by Hammerfist the giant. We negotiated **some** vials in exchange for completing Hammerfist's Request.

## Gulakkr's Armor (status: forgotten, T- 9 days)
The orc's armor appears bound to them, impeding their rest and general welfare.

## The Two Towers (status: rumoured)
We investigated an out-of-place looking bridge and are assuming the magically protected towers shoot evil entities.
In Loch Nosh we heard a rumour that the towers have stopped working due to the increased nearby undead.

## The Hooded Man's Request (status: tentative)
A suspicious robed man is looking for a singular sentence from a spell tome in the Moonstone Mountains.

## The Dwarven Troupe (status: in the dungeon of Drachenfells)
Two artificers have offered their services, they have made a bad(ass) dragon dildo in the past. They'll craft the king a crown. They want wands to build a wand golem.

## The Undead Menace (status: fake news)
An undead revenant and a flaming skull have been plaguing a nearby port town.

## Moonstone Smithing (status: in progress)
Loch Nosh's dwarven blacksmith buys Moonstone Ore.

## Ziggs's Juice (status: in progress)
Ziggs wants Giantwoods Sap in exchange for one cursed item from their wares.

## The Party Boat (status: passive)
The boat docked in Loch Nosh is a restaurant run by a powerful seaweed-wizard.

## The Asylum (status: mildly interested)
Loch Nosh's asylum is filled with Nyad-rejected noble bitches.

## Loch Nosh's Spire (status: rumoured)
There's a mysterious tower wizard in Loch Nosh.

## The Council's Request (status: ignored)
Loch Nosh's council asked us to do something about the recent undead spotted near the town.

## Hammerfist's Request (status: active)
Hammerfist has asked you to keep the forest quiet by freeing the villagers from slavers to the north.

## Riddletech Spire (status: active)
While tracking the slavers we stumbled across a tower filled with riddles and mechanical contraptions.
We survived the trial of strength on the second floor and collected its rewards.
